## To create a regression model to predict medexpense. ##
The data set contains data of a random sample of 10,089 people on how much they paid in out-of-pocket medical expenses in one year (medexpense).

The Dependent Variable - medexpense is right skewed and is not normally distributed. Therefore, is not suitable for OLS regression model. Log transformation can be applied to make the variable closer to normal.

## Best three Regression Models 
lm1 =lm(logmedexpense~healthins+age+female+income+illnesses+lowincome+educyr +private+verygood+good+fair +poor+poverty+midincome+msa+prioritylist,hi)
lm2 = lm(logmedexpense~healthins+age+female+illnesses+lowincome+educyr +private+verygood+good+fair+poor+poverty+midincome+msa+prioritylist,hi)
lm3 <- lmrob(logmedexpense~healthins+age+female+illnesses+lowincome+educyr +private+verygood+good+fair+poor+poverty+midincome+msa+prioritylist, data=hi)
